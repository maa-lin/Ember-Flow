        <h2>What is mindfullness</h2>
        <p>
            Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment—your thoughts, 
            feelings, and surroundings without judgment. It helps you slow down, notice what 
            you need, and make more intentional choices instead of running on autopilot. 
            Even a few mindful moments can bring clarity and calm to your day.</p>
